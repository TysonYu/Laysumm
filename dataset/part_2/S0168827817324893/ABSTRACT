ABSTRACT

TITLE

Toll-like receptor 7 agonist GS-9620 induces prolonged inhibition of HBV via a type I interferon-dependent mechanism

PARAGRAPH

GS-9620, an oral agonist of toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), is in clinical development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

GS-9620 was previously shown to induce prolonged suppression of serum viral DNA and antigens in the woodchuck and chimpanzee models of CHB.

Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the antiviral response to GS-9620 using in vitro models of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

PARAGRAPH

Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and differentiated HepaRG (dHepaRG) cells were infected with HBV and treated with GS-9620, conditioned media from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with GS-9620 (GS-9620 conditioned media [GS-9620-CM]), or other innate immune stimuli.

The antiviral and transcriptional response to these agents was determined.

PARAGRAPH

GS-9620 had no antiviral activity in HBV-infected PHH, consistent with low level TLR7 mRNA expression in human hepatocytes.

In contrast, GS-9620-CM induced prolonged reduction of HBV DNA, RNA, and antigen levels in PHH and dHepaRG cells via a type I interferon (IFN)-dependent mechanism.

GS-9620-CM did not reduce covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) levels in either cell type.

Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that GS-9620-CM strongly induced various HBV restriction factors – although not APOBEC3A or the Smc5/6 complex – and indicated that established HBV infection does not modulate innate immune sensing or signaling in cryopreserved PHH.

GS-9620-CM also induced expression of immunoproteasome subunits and enhanced presentation of an immunodominant viral peptide in HBV-infected PHH.

PARAGRAPH

Type I IFN induced by GS-9620 durably suppressed HBV in human hepatocytes without reducing cccDNA levels.

Moreover, HBV antigen presentation was enhanced, suggesting additional components of the TLR7-induced immune response played a role in the antiviral response to GS-9620 in animal models of CHB.
