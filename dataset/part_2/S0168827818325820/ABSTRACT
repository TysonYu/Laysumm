ABSTRACT

TITLE

Serum hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) correlates with covalently closed circular DNA transcriptional activity in chronic hepatitis B patients

PARAGRAPH

It has been proposed that serum hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) reflects intrahepatic covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA levels.

However, the correlation of HBcrAg with serum and intrahepatic viral markers and liver histology has not been comprehensively investigated in a large sample.

We aimed to determine if HBcrAg could be a useful therapeutic marker in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

PARAGRAPH

HBcrAg was measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay in 130 (36 hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]+ and 94 HBeAg−) biopsy proven, untreated, patients with chronic hepatitis B. HBcrAg levels were correlated with: a) serum hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA, quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen and alanine aminotransferase levels; b) intrahepatic total (t)HBV-DNA, cccDNA, pregenomic (pg)RNA and cccDNA transcriptional activity (defined as pgRNA/cccDNA ratio); c) fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity scores.

PARAGRAPH

HBcrAg levels were significantly higher in HBeAg+ vs. HBeAg− patients and correlated with serum HBV-DNA, intrahepatic tHBV-DNA, pgRNA and cccDNA levels, and transcriptional activity.

Patients who were negative for HBcrAg (<3 LogU/ml) had less liver cccDNA and lower cccDNA activity than the HBcrAg+ group.

Principal component analysis coupled with unsupervised clustering identified that in a subgroup of HBeAg− patients, higher HBcrAg levels were associated with higher serum HBV-DNA, intrahepatic tHBV-DNA, pgRNA, cccDNA transcriptional activity and with higher fibrosis and necroinflammatory activity scores.

PARAGRAPH

Our results indicate that HBcrAg is a surrogate marker of both intrahepatic cccDNA and its transcriptional activity.

HBcrAg could be useful in the evaluation of new antiviral therapies aiming at a functional cure of HBV infection either by directly or indirectly targeting the intrahepatic cccDNA pool.
