ABSTRACT

TITLE

Radiofrequency ablation vs. surgery for perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma: Propensity score analyses of long-term outcomes

PARAGRAPH

The therapeutic outcomes of surgical resection (SR) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for perivascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been compared.

The aim of this study was to compare SR with RFA as first-line treatment in patients with perivascular HCC and to evaluate the long-term outcomes of both therapies.

PARAGRAPH

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board.

The requirement for informed consent was waived.

Between January 2006 and December 2010, a total of 283 consecutive patients with small perivascular HCCs (≤3 cm, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A) underwent SR (n = 182) or RFA (n = 101) as a first-line treatment.

The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were compared by propensity score matching.

Subgroup analysis of these outcomes was conducted according to the type of hepatic vessels.

PARAGRAPH

The median follow-up was 7.8 years.

Matching yielded 62 pairs of patients.

In the two matched groups, the PFS rates at 5 and 10 years were 58.0% and 17.8%, respectively, in the SR group, and 25.4% and 14.1%, respectively, in the RFA group (p <0.001).

The corresponding OS rates at 5 and 10 years were 93.5% and 91.9% in the SR group and 82.3% and 74.1% in the RFA group, respectively (p <0.001).

In contrast to those in patients with perivenous HCCs, subgroup analysis indicated that extrahepatic recurrence and OS were significantly different according to the treatment modality in patients with periportal HCCs (p = 0.004 and p <0.001, respectively).

PARAGRAPH

In patients with small perivascular HCCs, SR provided better long-term tumor control and OS than RFA, particularly for periportal tumors.
