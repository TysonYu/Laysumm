ABSTRACT

TITLE

Declining hepatitis C virus-related liver disease burden in the direct-acting antiviral therapy era in New South Wales, Australia

PARAGRAPH

Population-level evidence for the impact of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related disease burden is lacking.

We aimed to evaluate trends in HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) hospitalisation, and liver-related and all-cause mortality in the pre-DAA (2001–2014) and DAA therapy (2015–2017) eras in New South Wales, Australia.

PARAGRAPH

HCV notifications (1993–2016) were linked to hospital admissions (2001–2017) and mortality (1995–2017).

Segmented Poisson regressions and Poisson regression were used to assess the impact of DAA era and factors associated with liver-related mortality, respectively.

PARAGRAPH

Among 99,910 people with an HCV notification, 3.8% had a decompensated cirrhosis diagnosis and 1.8% had an HCC diagnosis, while 3.3% and 10.5% died of liver-related and all-cause mortality, respectively.

In the pre-DAA era, the number of decompensated cirrhosis and HCC diagnoses, and liver-related and all-cause mortality consistently increased (incidence rate ratios 1.04 [95% CI 1.04–1.05], 1.08 [95% CI 1.07–1.08], 1.07 [95% CI 1.06–1.07], and 1.05 [95% CI 1.04–1.05], respectively) over each 6-monthly band.

In the DAA era, decompensated cirrhosis diagnosis and liver-related mortality numbers declined (incidence rate ratios 0.97 [95% CI 0.95–0.99] and 0.96 [95% CI 0.94–0.98], respectively), and HCC diagnosis and all-cause mortality numbers plateaued (incidence rate ratio 1.00 [95% CI 0.97–1.03] and 1.01 [95% CI 1.00–1.02], respectively) over each 6-monthly band.

In the DAA era, alcohol-use disorder (AUD) was common in patients diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis and HCC (65% and 46% had a history of AUD, respectively).

AUD was independently associated with liver-related mortality (incidence rate ratio 3.35; 95% CI 3.14–3.58).

PARAGRAPH

In the DAA era, there has been a sharp decline in liver disease morbidity and mortality in New South Wales, Australia.

AUD remains a major contributor to HCV-related liver disease burden, highlighting the need to address comorbidities.
