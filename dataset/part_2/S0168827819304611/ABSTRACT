ABSTRACT

TITLE

Real-life effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir in hepatitis C patients with previous DAA failure

PARAGRAPH

Sofosbuvir/velpatasivr/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) is approved for retreatment of patients with HCV and a previous failure on direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), however real-life data are limited.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of SOF/VEL/VOX in a real-life setting.

PARAGRAPH

All consecutive patients with HCV receiving SOF/VEL/VOX between May-October 2018 in 27 centers in Northern Italy were enrolled.

Bridging fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis (F4) were diagnosed by liver stiffness measurement: >10 and >13 kPa respectively.

Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as undetectable HCV-RNA 4 (SVR4) or 12 (SVR12) weeks after the end-of-treatment.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 179 patients were included: median age 57 (18–88) years, 74% males, median HCV-RNA 1,081,817 (482–25,590,000) IU/ml.

Fibrosis stage was F0-F2 in 32%, F3 in 21%, F4 in 44%.

HCV genotype was 1 in 58% (1b 33%, 1a 24%, 1nc 1%), 2 in 10%, 3 in 23% and 4 in 9%; 82% of patients carried resistance-associated substitutions in the NS3, NS5A or NS5B regions.

Patients received SOF/VEL/VOX for 12 weeks, ribavirin was added in 22% of treatment schedules.

Undetectable HCV-RNA was achieved by 74% of patients at week 4 and by 99% at week 12.

Overall, 162/179 (91%) patients by intention to treat analysis and 162/169 (96%) by per protocol analysis achieved SVR12, respectively; treatment failures included 6 relapsers and 1 virological non-responder.

Cirrhosis (p = 0.005) and hepatocellular carcinoma (p = 0.02) were the only predictors of treatment failure.

Most frequent adverse events included fatigue (6%), hyperbilirubinemia (6%) and anemia (4%).

PARAGRAPH

SOF/VEL/VOX is an effective and safe retreatment for patients with HCV who have failed on a previous DAA course in a real-life setting.
