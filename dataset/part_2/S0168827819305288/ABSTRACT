ABSTRACT

TITLE

IL-17A secreted from lymphatic endothelial cells promotes tumorigenesis by upregulation of PD-L1 in hepatoma stem cells

PARAGRAPH

The microenvironment regulates hepatoma stem cell behavior.

However, the contributions of lymphatic endothelial cells to the hepatoma stem cell niche remain largely unknown; we aimed to analyze this contribution and elucidate the mechanisms behind it.

PARAGRAPH

Associations between lymphatic endothelial cells and CD133+ hepatoma stem cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence and adhesion assays; with the effects of their association on IL-17A expression examined using western blot, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and luciferase reporter assay.

The effects of IL-17A on the self-renewal and tumorigenesis of hepatoma stem cells were examined using sphere and tumor formation assays.

The role of IL-17A in immune escape by hepatoma stem cells was examined using flow cytometry.

The expression of IL-17A in hepatoma tissues was examined using immunohistochemistry.

PARAGRAPH

CD133+ hepatoma stem cells preferentially interact with lymphatic endothelial cells.

The interaction between the mannose receptor and high-mannose type N-glycans mediates the interaction between CD133+ hepatoma stem cells and lymphatic endothelial cells.

This interaction activates cytokine IL-17A expression in lymphatic endothelial cells.

IL-17A promotes the self-renewal of hepatoma stem cells.

It also promotes their immune escape, partly through upregulation of PD-L1.

PARAGRAPH

Interactions between lymphatic endothelial cells and hepatoma stem cells promote the self-renewal and immune escape of hepatoma stem cells, by activating IL-17A signaling.

Thus, inhibiting IL-17A signaling may be a promising approach for hepatoma treatment.
