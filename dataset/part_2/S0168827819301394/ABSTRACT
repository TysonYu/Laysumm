ABSTRACT

TITLE

Liver transplantation using hepatitis B core positive grafts with antiviral monotherapy prophylaxis

PARAGRAPH

The impact of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive liver grafts on survival and the risk of de novo hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection after liver transplantation (LT) remain controversial.

Therefore, we aimed to analyze this risk and the associated outcomes in a large cohort of patients.

PARAGRAPH

This was a retrospective study that included all adults who underwent LT at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, between 2000 and 2015.

Data were retrieved from a prospectively collected database.

Antiviral monotherapy prophylaxis was given for patients receiving grafts from anti-HBc positive donors.

PARAGRAPH

A total of 964 LTs were performed during the study period, with 416 (43.2%) anti-HBc positive and 548 (56.8%) anti-HBc negative donors.

The median follow-up time was 7.8 years.

Perioperative outcomes (hospital mortality, complications, primary nonfunction and delayed graft function) were similar between the 2 groups.

The 1-, 5- and 10-year graft survival rates were comparable in anti-HBc positive (93.3%, 85.3% and 76.8%) and anti-HBc negative groups (92.5%, 82.9% and 78.4%, p = 0.944).

The 1-, 5- and 10-year patient survival rates in anti-HBc positive group were 94.2%, 87% and 79% and were similar to the anti-HBc negative group (93.5%, 84% and 79.7%, p = 0.712).

One-hundred and eight HBsAg negative recipients received anti-HBc positive grafts, of whom 64 received lamivudine and 44 entecavir monotherapy prophylaxis.

The risk of de novo HBV was 3/108 (2.8%) and all occurred in the lamivudine era.

There were 659 HBsAg-positive patients and 308 (46.7%) received anti-HBc positive grafts.

The risk of HBV recurrence was similar between the 2 groups.

Donor anti-HBc status did not impact on long-term patient and graft survival, or the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after LT.

PARAGRAPH

De novo HBV was exceedingly rare especially with entecavir prophylaxis.

Anti-HBc positive grafts did not impact on perioperative and long-term outcomes after transplant.
