ABSTRACT

TITLE

Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 contributes to pathogenesis of fulminant hepatitis via neutrophil-mediated complement activation

PARAGRAPH

The macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (Msr1, also called SRA) is a pattern recognition receptor primarily expressed on myeloid cells, which plays an important role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis.

Since MSR1 expression was upregulated in the livers of patients with fulminant hepatitis (FH), we investigated the functional mechanism of Msr1 in FH pathogenesis.

PARAGRAPH

Msr1-deficient (Msr1−/−) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain-A59 (MHV-A59) to induce FH, and the levels of tissue damage, serum alanine aminotransferase, inflammatory cytokines and complement component 5a (C5a) were measured and compared.

Liver injury was studied after MHV infection with or without neutrophil depletion.

PARAGRAPH

Our results showed that Msr1−/− mice were resistant to MHV-induced hepatitis.

Treatment with the C5a receptor antagonist (C5aRa) diminished the differences in inflammatory responses and liver injury between MHV-infected wild-type and Msr1−/− mice, suggesting that C5a-induced pro-inflammatory response plays a critical role in the Msr1-mediated regulation of FH pathogenesis.

We demonstrated that Msr1 efficiently enhanced transforming growth factor-activated kinase-1 phosphorylation in neutrophils upon MHV-A59 stimulation, thereby promoting the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway and subsequent NETosis formation.

Moreover, we provided evidence that blockage of Msr1 attenuated the liver damage caused by MHV-A59 infection.

PARAGRAPH

Msr1 promotes the pathogenesis of virus-induced FH by enhancing induction of neutrophil NETosis and subsequent complement activation.

Targeting Msr1 may be employed as a new immunotherapeutic strategy for FH.
