ABSTRACT

TITLE

Estimate of hepatocellular carcinoma incidence in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis

PARAGRAPH

More than 90% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occur in patients with cirrhosis, of which alcohol is a major cause.

The CIRRAL cohort aimed to assess the burden of complications in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, particularly the occurrence of HCC.

PARAGRAPH

Patients with biopsy-proven compensated alcoholic cirrhosis were included then prospectively followed.

The main endpoint was the incidence of HCC.

Secondary outcomes were incidence of hepatic focal lesions, overall survival (OS), liver-related mortality and event-free survival (EFS).

PARAGRAPH

From October 2010 to April 2016, 652 patients were included in 22 French and Belgian centers.

During follow-up (median 29 months), HCC was diagnosed in 43 patients.

With the limitation derived from the uncertainty of consecutive patients’ inclusion and from a sizable proportion of dropouts (153/652), the incidence of HCC was 2.9 per 100 patient-years, and one- and two-year cumulative incidences of 1.8% and 5.2%, respectively.

Although HCC fulfilled the Milan criteria in 33 cases (77%), only 24 patients (56%) underwent curative treatment.

An explorative prognostic analysis showed that age, male gender, baseline alpha-fetoprotein, bilirubin and prothrombin were significantly associated with the risk of HCC occurrence.

Among 73 deaths, 61 had a recorded cause and 27 were directly attributable to liver disease.

At two years, OS, EFS and cumulative incidences of liver-related deaths were 93% (95% CI 90.5–95.4), 80.3% (95% CI 76.9–83.9), and 3.2% (95% CI 1.6–4.8) respectively.

PARAGRAPH

This large prospective cohort incompletely representative of the whole population with alcoholic cirrhosis showed: a) an annual incidence of HCC of up to 2.9 per 100 patient-years, suggesting that surveillance might be cost effective in these patients; b) a high proportion of HCC detected within the Milan criteria, but only one-half of detected HCC cases were referred for curative treatments; c) a two-year mortality rate of up to 7%.
