ABSTRACT

TITLE

A multicenter study of entecavir vs. tenofovir on prognosis of treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B in South Korea

PARAGRAPH

It is currently unclear which antiviral agent, entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), is superior for improving prognosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

Here, we assessed the ability of these 2 antivirals to prevent liver-disease progression in treatment-naïve patients with CHB.

PARAGRAPH

From 2012 to 2014, treatment-naïve patients with CHB who received ETV or TDF as a first-line antiviral agent were recruited from 4 academic teaching hospitals.

Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at enrollment were excluded.

Cumulative probabilities of HCC and death or orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) were assessed.

PARAGRAPH

In total, 2,897 patients (1,484 and 1,413 in the ETV and TDF groups, respectively) were recruited.

The annual HCC incidence was not statistically different between the ETV and TDF groups (1.92 vs. 1.69 per 100 person-years [PY], respectively; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.975 [p = 0.852] by multivariate analysis).

Propensity score (PS)-matched and inverse probability of treatment weighting (ITPW) analyses yielded similar patterns of results (HR 1.021 [p = 0.884] and 0.998 [p = 0.988], respectively).

The annual incidence of death or OLT was not statistically different between the ETV and TDF groups (0.52 vs. 0.53 per 100 PY, respectively; adjusted HR 1.202 [p = 0.451]).

PS-matched and ITPW analyses yielded similar patterns of results (HR 1.248 [p = 0.385] and 1.239 [p = 0.360], respectively).

These findings were consistently reproduced in patients with compensated cirrhosis (all p >0.05).

PARAGRAPH

The overall prognosis in terms of HCC and death or OLT was not statistically different between the ETV and TDF groups.

Further studies are needed to validate our results.
